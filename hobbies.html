    <li><h4>Working Out</h4></li>
    <p>
        I love working out. It rejuvinates me and allowes me to eat everything that I love eating. I have built a great gym in my garage, which gives me a great amount of flexibility with my workouts. I can take 20 min breaks two or three times a day and go have a quick session. That keeps my metabolism high throughout the day and burn a good amount of calories.

    <li><h4>Coding</h4></li>
    <p>
        This is a new hobby I've picked up. I have just completed an HTML Capstone project which I've really enjoyed. I want to continue building my coding skills and continue exploring where this one goes.
